Password Generator

- Tasked with creating a calendar application that will allow a user to save events for each hour of the day.

- Was given a completed css file to use, but had to create the html and javascript files.

- The current day was to be displayed at the top of the calander

- Timeblocks were to be created for standard business hours, and each was to be color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future 

- Once text is entered into a timeblock, the user is to be able to save the text to the local storage once they click the save button. 

- When the user refreshes the page, the text is still there.
